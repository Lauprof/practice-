 	<h1>COMPUTER</h1>
 	<p style="font-family:monospace;">Computer refer to an electronic device that contains stored programs which help a user to accomplish specific tasks</p>
 	<img src="Laptop-computer.jpg" width="200px" height="auto">
 	<p style="font-family:monospace;">A computer needs electricity in order to run,this is because the basic operation of a computer is through binary .Binary refers to two ,thus digital electronics is the use of two states i.e ON and OFF to store data.
 	An off state is represented as a 0 and an on state is represented as a 1.All this depends on the state of billions of transistors.  </p>
 	<p style="font-family:monospace;">A transistor it consists of two PN -junctions producing three connecting terminals with each terminal being given a name to identify it from the other two.These three are the Emitter, the Base , the Collector .	The bjt uses both electron and hole charge carriers.The current flowing to the base controls the current at the collector thru the relation beta = Ic/Ib.Different arrangements of the transistors results to diffrent logic gates such as AND gate OR gate NAND gate NOR gate XNOR gate etc.</p>

	<h1><b>GENERATIONS OF COMPUTERS</b></h1>
	<p>The development of computer has undergone different stages and this has led to different generations of computers from first to the modern computers</p>
	<h2>First generation computers</h2>
	<p>The first computers were developed  between year 1940-1950.They were computers that used vaccum tubes for logic circuitry .The main characteristics were:
		<ul>
			<li>Main electronic component was vacuum tubes</li>
			<li>Main memory was based on magnetic drums and magnetic tapes</li>
			<li>The programming language was the machine language</li>
			<li>It consumed a lot of power and generate a lot of heat</li>
			<li>They were very slow and very large in size </li>
			<li>The input output devices were punched cards and paper tape</li>



		</ul></p><br><br><br><br><br>


<h2>Second generation computers</h3>
	<p>The second computers were developed between year 1950-1960.They were computers that used transistors for logic circuitry .The main characteristics were:
		<ul>
			<li>Main electronic component was transistor</li>
			<li>Main memory was based on magnetic cores and magnetic tapes</li>
			<li>The programming language was the assembly language</li>
			<li>It consumed a low power and generate a less  heat</li>
			<li>They had improved speed ,reliability and were smaller in size </li>
			<li>The input output devices were punched cards and paper tape</li>



		</ul></p><br><br><br><br><br>



<h2>Third generation computers</h4>
	<p>They were developed between year 1960s-1970s.They were computers that used integrated circuits for logic circuitry .The main characteristics were:
		<ul>
			<li>Main electronic component was ICs</li>
			<li>Main memory was based on large magnetic cores and magnetic tapes</li>
			<li>The programming language was high level language such as FORTRAN</li>
			<li>They were smaller cheaper and more efficient than 2nd generation </li>
			<li>They had improved speed and reliabiity</li>
			<li>The input output devices were punched cards and paper tape</li>



		</ul></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h2>Fourth generation computers</h3>
	<p>They were developed in the year 1970s to present day.They were computers that used very large scale integration and microprocessor for logic circuitry .The main characteristics were:
		<ul>
			<li>Main electronic component was large scale integration and microprocessor </li>
			<li>Main memory was based on semiconductor such as ram and rom</li>
			<li>The programming language was high level language such as Python ,Java ,Kotlin</li>
			<li>High speed and reliability compared to the third generation computers</li>
			<li>They are smaller cheaper and more efficient than the previous generations </li>
			<li>The input/output devices include keyboard,pointing devices,scanners,monitor</li>
            <li>They use networking </li>


		</ul></p><br><br><br><br><br><hr>



<h2>Fifth generation computers</h4>
	<p>These are present and future computers.They use ultra large scale integration technology for logic circuitry .The main characteristics were:
		<ul>
			<li>Main electronic component is based on artificial inteligence,parralel processing and ultra large scale integration technology</li>
			<li></li>
			<li>They understand human language</li>
			<li>They consume very little power and generate a less amount of heat</li>
			<li>They have remarkable speed and accuracy and reliability </li>
			<li>The input/output devices are keyboard,touchscreen,monitor,mouse,pen,speech ,lightscanner etc</li>
